As a SERC (Societal and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing) Scholar at the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, I worked with Dr. Anastasia Ostrowski on a project surrounding participatory design of generative AI for education, specifically looking at high schoolers.

We first interviewed seven high school teachers to better understand the educational environment surrounding GenAI in high schools. Informed by these interviews, we designed a participatory design workshop with 17 high school students involving a presentation on GenAI to ensure all participants had the proper vocabulary and knowledge to contribute, a tool design section, and a policy design section.
