In collaboration with Matt Taylor and Rachel Connolly, I developed a weeklong data science and machine learning curriculum that teaches high schoolers how to analyze climate data using Python through a narrative lens. The curriculum stresses how all data tells a story and provides high schoolers with ways to find the story in their chosen data.

The curriculum uses DeepNote notebooks and the Python library *pandas*. At the end, students produce a piece of data theatre and have learned how to analyze, clean, and visualize their data, as well as how to create a predictive machine learning model with their data.

The curriculum can be found on the Day of AI webpage [here](https://dayofai.wpenginepowered.com/curriculum/ai-programming-courses-with-python/#climatestories).
