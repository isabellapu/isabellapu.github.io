I am currently working on a project involving the use of physical props to aid children's emotional storytelling when guided by a social robot that can reference those props. This work will use the social robot, Jibo, and use emotional storytelling to help kids ages 5-8 practice social-emotional learning competencies. Children will choose props that aid them in telling an emotional story, guided by Jibo, and then participate in social-emotional learning practice about the story they just invented.
