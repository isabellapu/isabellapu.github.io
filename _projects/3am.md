I created a series of programmatic art pieces based on words and poetry using **p5.js**. You can experience this work [here](https://editor.p5js.org/isabellapu/full/Ha6191iqT) or view a demo below. *I highly recommend interacting directly with the piece.*

    A video demo, without sound, of "some things I think about between the hours of midnight and 3am". I highly encourage you to visit the p5.js link to experience this work for yourself if this demo intrigues you!
