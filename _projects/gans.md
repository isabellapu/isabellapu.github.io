In my junior independent work at Princeton University, I was advised by [Professor Adam Finkelstein](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~af/) on a project where I developed educational animations about GANs for an exhibit titled ["The Imitation Game"](https://imitationgameexhibition.ca/) at the Vancouver Art Gallery. These animations were designed to successfully educate and engage museum-goers without much, if any, technical knowledge. I was also advised by a curator of the exhibit, Glenn Entis.

As part of this work, I also trained several GANs to create assets for the animations. Over 85% of surveyed viewers reported
gaining substantial knowledge on GANs.

I created my animations in p5.js, and they were on display during the entire duration of the exhibit (March through October 2022), where they were viewed by hundreds of thousands of museum-goers.
