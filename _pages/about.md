Hi y'all! I'm **Isabella Pu**, a second year Master's student in the **[Personal Robots Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/personal-robots/overview/)** at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), studying with **[Professor Cynthia Breazeal](https://cynthiabreazeal.media.mit.edu/)**. I previously graduated from **[Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/)** with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and certificate in Robotics & Intelligent Systems.

Broadly, my research investigates how we can use **social robots and AI** to create **playful, engaging, and educational child-robot interactions**, focusing on children in grades K-5.

*This website is still a work in progress. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to [email me](mailto:ipu@media.mit.edu) if you have any inquiries.*
