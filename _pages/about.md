Hi y'all! I'm **Isabella Pu**, a first year PhD student in the **[Personal Robots Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/personal-robots/overview/)** at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), studying with **[Professor Cynthia Breazeal](https://cynthiabreazeal.media.mit.edu/)**. In 2023, I graduated from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and certificate in Robotics & Intelligent Systems, and in 2025 I received my Master's degree in Media Arts and Sciences from the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).

Broadly, my research investigates how we can use **social robots and AI** to create **playful, engaging, and educational child-robot/AI interactions**. As today's children become more immersed in AI and robots, it becomes increasingly important to empower children's usage of these technologies. In particular, I am interested designing and developing new AI and social robot interactions for fun, creative, and hands-on learning. I pursue this line of work in several ways:

 -  I create **child-robot and child-AI interactions** to investigate how children can interact with robots and AI in positive, engaging, and educational ways.
-   I design **K-12 curricula and learning experiences** to teach children about AI and robots, empowering them to use these technologies more confidently.
-   I develop **human-AI and human-robot co-creativity interactions** to encourage creative learning and creative uses of technology.

Previously, I have worked at [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/)  _(for the Horde!)_ on the Player Interactions & Trust team, building systems to detect disruptive behavior in games and help promote pro-social behavior. If you're interested in this, check out some of [the PIT team's amazing work](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23923815/coming-together-to-create-a-playbook-for-prosocial-game-design).

Outside of work, I am an avid achievement hunter and play all sorts of video games. I also follow fashion, write & play music, and write & perform poetry.
