Hi y'all! I'm **Isabella Pu**, a second year Master's student in the **[Personal Robots Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/personal-robots/overview/)** at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), studying with **[Professor Cynthia Breazeal](https://cynthiabreazeal.media.mit.edu/)**. I previously graduated from **[Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/)** with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and certificate in Robotics & Intelligent Systems.

Broadly, my research investigates how we can use **social robots and AI** to create **playful, engaging, and educational child-robot interactions**, focusing on children in grades K-5.

Previously, I have worked at [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/) _(for the Horde!)_ on the Player Interactions & Trust team, writing code to help detect disruptive behavior in games and help promote pro-social behavior. If you're interested in this, check out some of [the PIT team's work](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23923815/coming-together-to-create-a-playbook-for-prosocial-game-design).

Outside of work, I am an avid achievement hunter and play all sorts of video games. I also follow fashion, write & play music, and write & perform poetry.

_This website is still a work in progress. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to [email me](mailto:ipu@media.mit.edu) if you have any inquiries._
